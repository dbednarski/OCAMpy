# qe_lna

This repository contains three scripts to compute quantum efficience of camera OCAM2 (First Light). Measurements were taken at LNA (Brasil).

Order to run scripts:

1. raw2fits.py  --  converts raw data to fits
2. process_fits.py  --  reduces fits files, generating median images
3. QE_counts.py  --  computes the quantum efficiency
